                    No Obligation to Post Content. We have no obligation to post any content from you or anyone else. In addition, we may, in our sole and unfettered discretion, edit, remove or delete any content that you post or submit.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Third-party Content</h3>
            <p>In using our Services, you may be exposed to content and information from other users or third parties ("Third-Party Content"), either at our Site or through links to third-party websites. We do not control, and shall have no responsibility for, Third-Party Content, including material that may be unlawful, misleading, incomplete, erroneous, offensive, indecent or otherwise objectionable. You must evaluate the veracity of, and bear all risks associated with your exposure to, Third-Party Content.</p>
            <h3>Payment and transmission</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Payment Logistics. If you purchase a gift, you will be asked to provide your credit card information and billing address. We, or our payments provider, will obtain a pre-authorization for the total amount of the gift to ensure that you have the necessary amount of funds available to cover the transaction, but will not charge your card at that time. Pending a review of the transaction, your card will be charged the full balance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Redemption Logistics. Gift funds will be held at an FBO ("For Benefit Of") account owned by and maintained at Sunrise Banks, N.A. Once the gift recipient redeems their gift, GiftTicket will perform compliance and fraud reviews of the transaction. The gift funds will be dispersed from the FBO account pursuant to the recipient's instructions upon successful completion of the reviews.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We reserve the right to review, postpone, or cancel the purchase of any gift or the dispersal of funds to any user at our discretion.
                </li>
                <li>Cancellation and Refunds. If a gift does not meet your expectations, it is cancellable for a full refund within 30 days of purchase provided that it has not been redeemed. Exceptions to this policy are gifts that have been purchased through the bulk order form or API; they are non-refundable in all circumstances.</li>
                <li>Additional information from sender or recipient. You accept that GiftTicket may, at its sole discretion, request additional personal information about the sender or recipient of a gift if it deems appropriate. Such information may include, but is not limited to, a user's address, date of birth, or SSN last four digits. If the information is not provided, is inaccurate, or cannot be confirmed, GiftTicket may cancel the gift.</li>
                <li>Risk of loss. Neither we nor our banking partners are not responsible if a GiftTicket is lost, stolen, destroyed, or used without your permission.</li>
                <li>Taxes. Because state and local tax laws vary significantly by locality, you understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining your own tax reporting requirements in consultation with tax advisors.</li>
                <li>Fee Structure and Schedule. You understand that GiftTicket charges a service fee at the time of purchase. This fee is not recoverable and will not be applied towards the balance in the special purpose account opened for you. You also understand that the amount of the service fee may vary substantially during the lifetime of the product, and therefore you may be charged different service fees at different times. Furthermore, when GiftTicket determines that a gift is unlikely to be redeemed, a fee may be assessed against the account. GiftTicket will use statistical methods to determine whether a gift is unlikely to be redeemed. When the fee is due, you authorize GiftTicket to disburse funds from the account associated with your gift that’s unlikely to be redeemed to pay the fee.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Proprietary Rights</h3>
            <ul>
