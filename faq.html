            <h3 class="faq_question">What is GiftTicket?</h3>
            <p class="faq_answer">

                The receiver gets a <strong>physical scratch-off card</strong> and is flooded with anticipation for winning. Yet, unlike <strong>lottery scratch-off tickets</strong>, this one is <strong>rigged to win</strong>. The person gifting
                has fun toying with emotions while being on the receiving-end of <strong>enhanced gratitude</strong>. It's like a <strong>cash gift card</strong> without the risk of losing or wasting money!
